# Music App UI

This is a **Music App UI** created using **Android Jetpack Compose**. The app demonstrates a modern and intuitive user interface for a music streaming application, including essential screens and navigation components. This project focuses on the design aspect, and while the UI is fully functional, the backend functionality for music playback is not implemented.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays playlists like new releases and other music categories.
- **Bottom Navigation**: Provides easy access to different sections of the app such as Home, Search, Library, etc.
- **Drawer Navigation**: Allows users to navigate through additional options like Settings and Profile.
- **Options Menu & Bottom Sheet**: The options menu allows users to access additional settings, and on selection, a bottom sheet is displayed for more actions.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The entire UI is built using Jetpack Compose, making the app highly responsive and modern.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: For Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: To create a modern, declarative UI.
- **Material Design Components**: For designing the bottom navigation, drawer, and bottom sheet.
- **Navigation Component**: Used for handling bottom navigation and drawer navigation.
